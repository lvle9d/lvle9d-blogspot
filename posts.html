                            Easily overlooked but never underappreciated, this local beergarden/venue is tucked away in the unsuspecting neighborhood of Avondale.
                            Often mistaken for an office on the outside but can distinguish otherwise with its beautiful artisic black and white mural. 
                            During the daytime this venue transforms into a coffee bar, perfect seating area if you need some quiet time to study and or do some remote work. 
                            That is until the nighttime when this venue comes alive just as much as the people whom flock to it. 
                            From bands to dj’s to comedians this Sleeping Village has plenty of forms of entertainment to offer their community.
                            Weekly they change the beers that they offer and even can enjoy with their quant patio encompassed by lights that truly build the atmosphere.

                            With its surfboard sign and tropical colors its very hard to miss this Hawaiian eatery. Found in the Lakeview East Aloha Eats is a unique must stop in the city of Chicago. 
                            Aloha Eats food captures every bit of the islands essence. 
                            Their walls are covered with memorabilia from the tropical paradise and pictures of both Chicago and Hawaiian locals breaking bread. 
                            Hailed for so many of their entrees, it is hard to pass on their Musubi. 
                            Offered Katsu style meaning fried in panko breading this Hawaiian rice roll is not for the faint of heart. 
                            Overwhelming with flavor and compact for an on the go lifestyle, these are a tasty treat you cannot pass up.
                            If by chance you have time to sit down, try the classic chicken katsu curry comes with a heaping pile of rice and generous portion of Hawaiian macaroni salad.
                            Do not pass up the chance to be served some true comfort food as this place hits it out of the park.

                        <p class="article-listing-body">
                            The Ginza Festival is a wonderful Japanese Festival held annually at the Midwest Buddhist Temple 
                            where the members serve food and educate the community about Japanese customs, culture and art. 
                            There are plenty events held from drum circles, traditional plays and judo demonstrations held by local dojos. 
                            Enjoy authentic Japanese cuisine while you watch the shows or take it around to observe all the art and jewelry 
                            vendors from various areas of the States.
                            Take time to view the inside of the beautiful temple and sit in and learn about buddhist culture and customs. 
                            Share stories with all people alike whom share the same affinity of Japanese culture.

                            There are plenty of scenic views of the city but I am partial to Montrose Beach. 
                            Here you’ll find plenty of things to see such as skateboarders tearing up a bowl, 
                            legions of dogs wrestling each other in the sand, volleyball tournaments, early morning local fisherman, 
                            nature walks for the bird lovers and last but not least an amazing view of the city’s breathtaking landscape.
                            I like going in the morning time for long walks and chilling in the park, its often you see plenty of people trying 
                            to do the same catching rays of sunshine and or working their sailboats at the docks. 
                            The beach is never short of views and events in the summertime. Here they host several events as well from marathons to music festivals.
                            Needless to say its impossible to bored when you’re visiting one of the lakes most amazing features.

                        <p class="article-listing-body">
                            Located in the heart of Lincoln Square in the Giddings Plaza, Cafe Selmarie’s is a French Patisserie. 
                            They have been serving the community as early as 1983. This bakery brings much foot traffic and is a step away 
                            from the busy streets of Chicago with a very European feel. It is not uncommon to see a lot of foot traffic surrounding their beautiful storefront and patio. 
                            The gatherings are not just for the aesthetic but primarily for their pastries, coffee and authentic French entrees. 
                            Visiting Selmarie it goes without saying decision making is difficult especially upon a first visit. 
                            Their glass glows with their impressive display of goods. My personal favorite item of choice is the rustic almond raspberry torte, 
                            the spongey density of the torte coupled with the base layer of raspberry compote is a perfect treat with a nice shot of espresso.
                            Excellent place to go to relax and or bring a first date, the atmosphere is both quaint and charismatic. Whether it is summertime 
                            and or winter time there’s no reason why Cafe Selmarie shouldn’t be a must go destination here in the Windy City!
