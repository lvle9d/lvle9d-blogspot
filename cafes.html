                        <p class="article-listing-body">
                            Easily overlooked but never underappreciated, this local beergarden/venue is tucked away in the unsuspecting neighborhood of Avondale.
                            Often mistaken for an office on the outside but can distinguish otherwise with its beautiful artisic black and white mural. 
                            During the daytime this venue transforms into a coffee bar, perfect seating area if you need some quiet time to study and or do some remote work. 
                            That is until the nighttime when this venue comes alive just as much as the people whom flock to it. 
                            From bands to dj’s to comedians this Sleeping Village has plenty of forms of entertainment to offer their community.
                            Weekly they change the beers that they offer and even can enjoy with their quant patio encompassed by lights that truly build the atmosphere.

                        <h3 class="article-listing-title">Cafe Selmarie</h3>
                        <p class="article-listing-body">
                            Located in the heart of Lincoln Square in the Giddings Plaza, Cafe Selmarie’s is a French Patisserie. 
                            They have been serving the community as early as 1983. This bakery brings much foot traffic and is a step away 
                            from the busy streets of Chicago with a very European feel. It is not uncommon to see a lot of foot traffic surrounding their beautiful storefront and patio. 
                            The gatherings are not just for the aesthetic but primarily for their pastries, coffee and authentic French entrees. 
                            Visiting Selmarie it goes without saying decision making is difficult especially upon a first visit. 
                            Their glass glows with their impressive display of goods. My personal favorite item of choice is the rustic almond raspberry torte, 
                            the spongey density of the torte coupled with the base layer of raspberry compote is a perfect treat with a nice shot of espresso.
                            Excellent place to go to relax and or bring a first date, the atmosphere is both quaint and charismatic. Whether it is summertime 
                            and or winter time there’s no reason why Cafe Selmarie shouldn’t be a must go destination here in the Windy City!
